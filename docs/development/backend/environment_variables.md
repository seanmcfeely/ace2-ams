# Environment Variables

The backend container relies on a number of environment variables. For the development environment, these are automatically generated by the `bin/reset-dev-container.sh` script and stored inside of the `.ace2.env` file inside of your home directory.

These environment variables will need to be set by other means if you are running this application in production.

## FastAPI backend variables

These variables are used by the FastAPI backend application.

- **ACE_DEV**: If set (to anything), the application will run in development-mode, which means that the Alembic database migrations will be applied and the database seeded with basic information automatically when the application starts.
- **COOKIES_SAMESITE**: The `SameSite` value to use when sending cookies. The development environment uses `lax`. Defaults to `lax`.
- **COOKIES_SECURE**: True/False whether or not you want to require HTTPS when sending cookies. The development environment uses `False`. Defaults to `True`.
- **CORS_ORIGINS**: A comma-separated string of origins to allow with CORS. For example, your development environment should be set to something like `http://localhost:8080` depending on which port the GUI is served from.
- **DATABASE_URL**: The connection string used to connect to the PostgreSQL server. It should be in the form of `postgresql://user:password@hostname[:port]/dbname`.
- **JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRE_SECONDS**: The number of seconds after which an access token will expire. The development environment uses `900` (15 minutes) by default.
- **JWT_ALGORITHM**: Sets the algorithm to use for signing the tokens. The development environment uses `HS256` by default.
- **JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRE_SECONDS**: The number of seconds after which a refresh token will expire. The development environment uses `43200` (12 hours) by default.
- **JWT_SECRET**: The secret key/password to use when signing and decoding tokens. The development environment generates `a random 32 character string`.

## PostgreSQL container variables

These variables are used by the PostgreSQL server container to initialize the database.

- **POSTGRES_DB**: The name of the database to create. The development environment uses `ace`.
- **POSTGRES_USER**: The user to use to connect to the PostgreSQL server. The development environment uses `ace`.
- **POSTGRES_PASSWORD**: The password to use to connect to the PostgreSQL server. The development environment generates `a random 32 character string`.
