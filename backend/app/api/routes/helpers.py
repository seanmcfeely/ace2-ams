# The trailing slash is required due to how some of the API endpoints are organized. For instance, there is a
# /user/ endpoint and a /user/role/ endpoint. If you were to drop the trailing slash and tried to access /user/role,
# it would not know if you wanted to access the get_all_user_roles endpoint or were trying to access the "role" user,
# which is invalid since you must supply a UUID in order to retrieve a user.
